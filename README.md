# Tracing for the Epsilon Transformation Language

A method of retaining all relational links between transformation invocations allowing one to:

1. Derive rule dependencies.
2. Recreate invocations for more effective maintenence when working with side effects.
3. Capturing orphaned objects, created outside of the transformation definition.
